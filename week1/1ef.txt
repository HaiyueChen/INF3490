1.e Possible improvements
Gradient ascent and hill climbing are quite similar, and they are based almost exclusively on exploitation. Can
you think of any additions to these algorithms in order to do more exploration?

    - We can have multiple starting points and a lower value for step length.

1.f Exhaustive search vs. simulated annealing
Which algorithm do you think is the most efficient at maximizing f(x) under the conditions in Problem 1.d;
exhaustive search or simulated annealing? Explain.

    -I think in the situation of 1d, exhaustive search would be the better algorithm. Because the search speace is very small and thus 
     the exhaustive search algorithm would be grarantied to provide the most optimal solution within a reasonable time.
